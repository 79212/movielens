    "# Building a Movies Recommendation Engine\n",
    "“What movie should I watch this evening?” — have you ever had to answer this question at least once when you came home from work? As for me — yes, and more than once. From Netflix to Hulu, the need to build robust movie recommendation systems is extremely important given the huge demand for personalized content of modern consumers.\n",

    "In this notebook, I will attempt at implementing a few algorithms (content based, popularity based and collaborative filtering) to recommend movies and evaluate them to see which one performs the best.\n",

    "## The MovieLens Dataset\n",
    "One of the most common datasets that is available on the internet for building a Recommender System is the [MovieLens DataSet](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/). This version of the dataset that I'm working with ([1M](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/1m/)) contains 1,000,209 anonymous ratings of approximately 3,900 movies made by 6,040 MovieLens users who joined MovieLens in 2000.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data was collected by GroupLens researchers over various periods of time, depending on the size of the set. This 1M version was released on February 2003. Users were selected at random for inclusion. All users selected had rated at least 20 movies. Each user is represented by an id, and no other information is provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original data are contained in three files, [movies.dat](https://github.com/khanhnamle1994/movielens/blob/master/dat/movies.dat), [ratings.dat](https://github.com/khanhnamle1994/movielens/blob/master/dat/ratings.dat) and [users.dat](https://github.com/khanhnamle1994/movielens/blob/master/dat/users.dat). To make it easier to work with the data, I used a [script](https://github.com/khanhnamle1994/movielens/blob/master/dat_to_csv.py) to convert the .dat files into [.csv files](https://github.com/khanhnamle1994/movielens/tree/master/csv)."
