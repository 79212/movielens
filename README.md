# MovieLens Recommendation Systems

This repo shows a set of Jupyter notebooks demonstrating a variety of movie recommendation systems for the [MovieLens 1M dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/1m/). The dataset contain 1,000,209 anonymous ratings of approximately 3,900 movies made by 6,040 MovieLens users who joined MovieLens in 2000.

Here are the different notebooks:
* [Data Processing](https://github.com/khanhnamle1994/movielens/blob/master/Data_Processing.ipynb): Loading and processing the users, movies, and ratings data to prepare them for input into my models.
* [Content-Based and Collaborative Filtering](https://github.com/khanhnamle1994/movielens/blob/master/Content_Based_and_Collaborative_Filtering_Models.ipynb): Using the Content-Based and Collaborative Filtering approach
